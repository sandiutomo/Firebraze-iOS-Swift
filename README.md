Firebraze

Firebraze is an iOS template that enables sending GA4-structured analytics events to Braze via Google Tag Manager (GTM).
It acts as a translation layer between GA4’s event & ecommerce data model and Braze’s event, purchase, and user attribute APIs.

This project is designed for teams who want consistent analytics instrumentation, scalable event governance, and clean separation between app code and marketing SDK logic.
